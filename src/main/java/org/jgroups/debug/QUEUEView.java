/**
   Shows the internals of the QUEUE protocol. Imlements QUEUE.Observer, gets called before an event
   is added to the (internal) up- or down-queue of QUEUE (<em>not</em>Protocol !). This allows
   to see what's going on in QUEUE. QUEUEView can also query the attributes of QUEUE, e.g. up_vec,
   dn_vec etc.<br>
   QUEUEView is implemented as a JPanel, and not as a JFrame, so it can be displayed inside the
   Debugger's own view.
